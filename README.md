- **Real-time Messaging**: Communication between food providers and recipients
- **User Profiles**: Manage personal information and track food listings
- **Location-based Functionality**: Map integration for food pickup locations

## Backend Architecture

The backend is built with Flask and includes the following components:

- **Flask**: Python web framework for handling HTTP requests
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions
- **Werkzeug**: For password hashing and security
- **Flask-Mail**: For sending password reset emails
- **Flask-CORS**: For cross-origin resource sharing with the React frontend

### Database Models
- `User` and `Role`: User authentication and permissions
- `FoodListing`: Food item information and availability
- `Chat`: Messaging between users about food listings

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Node.js and npm (for frontend)

### Database and Schema Setup

1. The application uses SQLite which doesn't require separate installation

2. The database schema is defined in both `app.py` and `resource_db_setup.py`

3. Database models include:
   - `Role`: User roles (undergrad, master, phd, employee, professor)
   - `User`: User information and authentication data
   - `FoodListing`: Food donation details and availability
   - `Chat`: Messaging between users

4. The database is automatically created when you first run the application with:
   ```python
   with app.app_context():
       db.create_all()
       setup_roles()
   ```

5. You can initialize test data using the endpoint:
   ```
   GET /add_test_data
   ```
   This will create a test user and food listing for development purposes

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory

2. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure email settings in `app.py`:
```python
app.config['MAIL_USERNAME'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_USERNAME', 'YOUR_MAIL_USERNAME')
app.config['MAIL_PASSWORD'] = os.environ.get('MAIL_PASSWORD', 'YOUR_MAIL_PASSWORD')
```
   - Enter your Google email address for `YOUR_MAIL_USERNAME`
   - Create an app password from Google Account settings for `YOUR_MAIL_PASSWORD`

4. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python app.py
```
   The server will start on http://localhost:5000

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```
   The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Proposal
- Project Overview
> ReSource is a comprehensive platform designed to address resource inequality by connecting those with surplus resources to those in need. The platform will be developed in a phased approach, initially focusing on food redistribution to combat hunger, followed by book sharing to improve access to educational materials, with potential future expansions to furniture redistribution and financial contributions. By leveraging technology and community engagement, ReSource creates an efficient ecosystem for resource redistribution, reducing waste while addressing fundamental needs.
- Problem Statement
> Our society faces significant paradoxes of abundance and scarcity existing simultaneously. While millions struggle with food insecurity, approximately one-third of all food produced globally is wasted. Similarly, educational inequality persists partly due to uneven access to learning materials, while many households have books that are no longer needed or used. ReSource seeks to bridge these gaps by creating infrastructure that efficiently redistributes surplus resources to those who need them most.

### Conclusion
> ReSource aims to create a sustainable solution to resource inequality through a phased approach that prioritizes food redistribution, followed by book sharing and potentially furniture and financial contributions. The platform's strategic development plan ensures that at least one critical function‚Äîfood sharing‚Äîis fully operational before expanding to additional resources. By focusing initially on addressing food insecurity, ReSource will establish its core infrastructure, user base, and operational processes. This foundation will then support the seamless integration of book sharing, primarily benefiting students and lifelong learners who lack access to educational materials. The technical architecture, built on React, Flask, PostgreSQL, and Google Cloud Platform, provides a robust framework that allows for both current functionality and future expansion. JWT authentication ensures secure user interactions, while the modular design enables the team to adapt to changing timelines and requirements. Through this thoughtfully sequenced approach, ReSource will maximize its impact and sustainability, ensuring that even if development challenges arise, the platform will still deliver meaningful value by reducing waste and addressing critical community needs.
